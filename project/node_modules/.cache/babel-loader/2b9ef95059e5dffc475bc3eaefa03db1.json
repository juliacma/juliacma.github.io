This program will introduce the concepts of evolution, natural selection and species with examples from the Museum's dioramas, specimens, casts and pelts.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    <b>Birds and Their Adaptations</b>\n                    <br/><i>Elementary and Middle School</i>\n                    <br/>The Yale Peabody Museum’s wonderful Birds of Connecticut Hall provides a focus for learning about wild animals that are part of our everyday lives. Every child sees birds, yet most know very little about these fascinating creatures. Seeing such common birds as the ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) can help students be more aware of wild animals that are part of their world. The instructor will also discuss concepts basic to the science of biology, including animal adaptations, migration and endangered species, appropriate to the ability of the students and their interests.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    <b>Biodiversity</b>\n                    <br/><i>Elementary School</i>\n                    <br/>The Museum’s North American Dioramas reveal the diversity of life on our continent.  Using these “windows into the natural world” to illustrate the concept of biodiversity, this program will compare and contrast the variety of plant and animal life associated with these representatives of North America's biomes.  The contributions of biotic and abiotic factors to species diversity will be explored using activities and hands-on objects.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    <b>Connecticut Habitats and Wildlife</b>\n                    <br/><i>Elementary and Middle School</i>\n                    <br/>The Connecticut dioramas were developed with the help of one of the founders of the science of ecology, G. Evelyn Hutchinson. These Yale Peabody Museum's dioramas allow the students to visualize complex food webs and ecology in four distinct habitat types present in Connecticut.  This program focuses on habitat, with an investigation of biotic and abiotic factors, biodiversity, and human impacts.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    <b>Extinct and Endangered Species</b>\n                    <br/><i>Grade 4 through High School</i>\n                    <br/>Although most people have been introduced to the issue of extinction as a modern problem, it is a naturally occurring process going back to the beginning of life on Earth. Extinction can have many causes, but primary amount them are habitat loss and climate change.  While highlighting examples of extinction in the distant past, this program also presents the rate of modern extinctions and how human activities may be a contributing factor.  Using exhibits and specimens relating to extinct and endangered plants and animals both locally and throughout North America, the program will explore how individuals can make a difference.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    <b>Habitat and Human Impacts</b>\n                    <br/><i>Elementary School</i>\n                    <br/>Developed to meet NGSS standards, this new program will explore the concept of habitat by highlighting components of the Peabody Museum’s expertly crafted dioramas in addition to hands-on specimens and objects.  Case studies of several species will highlight human impacts and present students with opportunities to discover ways to reduce the impact of humans on the environment.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    <b>Introduction to Evolution</b>\n                    <br/><i>Middle and High School</i>\n                    <br/>Outstanding exhibits of prehistoric animal and plant fossils are used to illustrate current theories on the mechanisms of biological change that are evolution.  These specimens provide evidence for the process of evolution through natural selection and genetic mutation.  Evolution has been a primary research subject at the Peabody Museum for more than 100 years and many of the Museum's exhibits were produced to promote the understanding of evolution.  Specimens will highlight current research on the close relationship between birds and dinosaurs, horse evolution, mass extinctions and a brief look at human origins.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    <b>Light, Color and Nature</b>\n                    <br/><i>Elementary and Middle School</i>\n                    <br/>What is light? How are rainbows formed? Do polar bears really have white fur? This program is an introduction to light and color with an emphasis on human vision, how we perceive light, and how color is used in nature. Using hands-on models and demonstrations this class begins with Newton’s famous prism experiment of the 1600’s and continues with an exploration of human eye anatomy. Students will also explore how animals use color to adapt to various environments through camouflage, mimicry or announcing colors.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    <b>North American Wildlife and Ecology</b>\n                    <br/><i>Grade 3 through High School</i>\n                    <br/>The Yale Peabody Museum's eight North American dioramas represent habitat regions throughout North America, including the tundra, high mesa, rainforest, grasslands, desert and marsh. Each diorama highlights the variety of animal and plant life in these specific natural regions. Teachers are invited to choose areas that fit their curriculum. Viewing the representations of each provides the basis for a thoughtful discussion about the biodiversity, history, differences and similarities of each of these areas. Students will have the opportunity to touch an Arctic musk ox specimen and consider its various evolutionary adaptations, as well as adaptations of other animals and plants represented in the dioramas.\n                </p>\n\n                <br/>\n                <h3>Earth Science</h3>\n                <p>\n                    <b>Landforms: Evidence of a Changing Earth</b>\n                    <br/><i>Middle and High School</i>\n                    <br/>Using museum specimens, exhibits and activities, Landforms: Evidence of a Changing Earth brings the concept of a dynamic Earth to life.
