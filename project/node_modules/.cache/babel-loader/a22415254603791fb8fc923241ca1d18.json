Featuring skeletons from the Museum’s world-renowned paleontology collections, it is also home to Rudolph Zallinger’s famous mural The Age of Reptiles. The hall contains the dinosaurs Deinonychus, Camarasaurus, Stegosaurus, Camptosaurus, and of course the Brontosaurus.</p>\n\n            <br/>\n            <div className=\"rule\"></div>\n            <br/>\n            <img className={classNames(\"imageKing\", \"imageQueen\")} src={NAdioramas} alt =\"North American Dioramas\"></img>\n            <h3>North American Dioramas</h3>\n            <p>The North American dioramas capture three scenes of the nature on our continent. In the museum world, the Yale Peabody Museum’s dioramas are considered masterpieces. In them our eye moves effortlessly from the specimens in the foreground to the background through the veil of atmosphere, into a vista that seems to stretch endlessly beyond the horizon. We accept the diorama as casually as if it were a window into the natural world.</p>\n\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <img className={classNames(\"imageKing\", \"imageQueen\")} src={mammals} alt =\"Mammal Evolution\"></img>\n            <h3>Whitney Hall: Mammal Evolution</h3>\n            <p>After the extinction of the dinosaurs, the mammals began to dominate the Earth. The fossils in this hall, from the Yale Peabody Museum’s collections in the Division of Vertebrate Paleontology, belong to the main groups of mammals that evolved during the Cenozoic Era (65&nbsp;million years ago to the present), after the extinction of the dinosaurs.  These animals can be traced to modern mammals, like horses, camels, and dogs.  This gallery also contains the Otisville Mastodon (Mammut americanus) and the huge Brontotherium, both acquired in the 19th&nbsp;century by Yale’s O.C. Marsh.</p>\n\n            <br/> \n            <br/>                          \n            <img className={classNames(\"imageKing\", \"imageQueen\")} src={oceans} alt =\"Hall of Ancient Oceans\"></img>\n            <h3>Hall of Ancient Oceans</h3>\n            <p>From the Archelon and the Mososaur swimming above, to the jars of phytoplankton below, you can view the wide variety of ocean life present in the Peabody's collection.
