				<h2>Dear Weekly Laundry Doer</h2>
				<p>This broadside was created in response to the prompt of a favorite place on Yale University's campus. Farnam Hall was the freshman dorm I lived in at the time. The laundry room was one of two on Old Campus (the freshman quad). It was, to me, the intersection of gathering and solitude, of chaos and calm, of everything and nothingness. One copy of the broadside hung on the laundry room wall for the remainder of the academic year.</p>

				<p>This broadside was printed in an edition of 8 in 2015 using the Vandercook Press in Jonathan Edwards College Press. The image was printed from two hand-carved linoleum blocks. The typefaces used are Helvetica Bold and Garamond. The poster was created for the Yale course Art 006 Art of the Printed Word, taught by Master Printer Richard Rose.</p>
